                        Each player will be given a set of initial armies, with each player receiving fewer if there are more players. Each player takes turns placing one army around the map by clicking on the button of a territory. This continues until each player has run out of armies at which point the game starts. You should place armies so as to capture continents (indicated by a background colour on the map) , reinforce borders with other players and prevent others from taking certain areas of the map.

                        In New Risk, you chance of winning a battle is related to the number of armies attacking versus those defending with more attacking being in your favour. Defending armies have an advantage, set by the Defense Bias in setup. Both sides will suffer casualties in a battle, losing more if they were unlikely to win. Each battle ends with all of the attackers or defenders being eliminated. If all the defenders are eliminated you proceed to an additional phase where you can conquer your newly captured territory.

                        In Classic Risk, you attack with 1-3 armies and the defender defends with 2 armies, unless there is only one in the defending territory. Each army rolls a dice, with the highest roll from each side being selected. While the dice are rolling the timer does not count down. If the attacker rolls a higher number than the defence, the defending army is defeated. If both armies roll 2 or more dice, the next highest are then matched and the process repeated. If there are no longer any armies to defend the territory after an attack, you may now conquer it. If there are armies remaining, you are returned to the attack phase.

                        In the conquer phase, you choose how many armies you would like to move from the attacking territory into the newly captured one. This is achieved using the same L/R click and + - buttons as all other actions. You must move at least as many armies as survived the attack. You must confirm this action and your turn cannot end during it. After conquering, if your time has not run out you return to the attack phase.

                        During a move phase, you can move armies between your territories provided they are linked by other territories you own. Click on the territory you wish to move armies from and your available moves are highlighted with a light blue border. Click on one of these and use the +- or mouse buttons to adjust the number you wish to move, using confirm to confirm the move. This will end your turn. If you do not wish to move you can use the "Continue" button to skip.
